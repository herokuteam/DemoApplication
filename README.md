## Relevant code
The only things that had to be changed after creating the app using `activator new hello-world play-java` were in these files:

* `app/controllers/Application.java`
* `app/views/*`
* `/conf/routes`
## Adding bootstrap


See http://www.webjars.org/documentation to start out, but then look at [my commit](https://github.com/kjorg50/play-2.3-hello-world/commit/680bd8cf2e49f34abd1c558ce5df04ce59354ae1), to see exactly what I changed. I also
used a little bit of the tutorial here http://thomastoye.be/webdevelopment/making-bootstrap-3-dot-1-x-play-nicely-with-play-framework-2-dot-2-x/
